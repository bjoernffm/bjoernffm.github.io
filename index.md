## Seven Segment Display

[Open Repository](https://github.com/bjoernffm/seven-segment-display)

#### Description

The [seven segment display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display) has a unique and interesting look - worth a short afternoon project. Instead of using a font that looks like the real thing, my intention was to program the whole unit from scratch creating an ardoino like api.
